This application is a MQTT-SN sensor node. It communicates with a D6T-8L thermal sensor through I2C. Through the connection, it retrieves measurement values, converts them into temperature values, and process them with a person detection algorithm. The algorithm compares each of the temperature value with the sensors reference value. The application then publishes the result of the algorithm.
